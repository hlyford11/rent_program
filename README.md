# rent_program
A program to speed up collecting rent from the roommates

Note #1: Due to me being somewhat confused by jsonp, using this will likely require the CORS plug-in for Chrome (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-control-allow-origi/nlfbmbojpeacfghkpbjhddihlkkiljbi?hl=en)

Note #2: The access token used in the POST request is in a gitignored file so this won't work unless you add your own. Can get the token for your account by going to: https://venmo.com/account/settings/developers.
